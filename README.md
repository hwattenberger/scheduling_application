<p align="center"> This is a full stack application geared towards restaurants that have many shift works where availability could change throughout a week (students, part time workers, etc).

## üßê Problem Statement/Business Case <a name = "businesscase"></a>
It is hard to schedule lots of part time staff.  While their availability may be consistent from week to week, they need time off or can only work once a week or have various other challenges.  When I worked in a restaurant, the manager spent hours a week scheduling everyone.  Similarly it's tough for busy part time workers to remember when they were scheduled and to show up on time.  The goal of this project is to help both types of people.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Front end framework
- [MaterialUI](https://v4.mui.com/) - React UI components
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Back end
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Back end framework 
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database
- Also passport (authentication), dayjs (date library), Cloudinary (image storage)

## üßê Features <a name = "about"></a>
For Managers (Only available for users who are marked as admins):
- Create staff roles (sever, manager, host, etc.) and shift types (AM server shift, PM host shift)
- Manage staff (activate & deactivate/turn into admin/manage staff information including staff role, image)
- Create weekly schedules to publish to your staff.  More details on scheduling below.

For Staff:
- Update weekly availability and user information
- Create time off requests
- See upcoming shifts

General Features:
- Authentication either natively with a username and password OR through Google

Scheduling information:
- Schedules are created from a combination of each user's specified weekly availability and their time off requests.
- You can copy forward the schedule from last week and it will keep all scheduled shifts unless users have requested time off (so you don't mistakenly schedule someone for a shift when they aren't available).
- Users are scheduled for a specific shift on a specific date.  You can schedule them in the scheduling activity either by selecting a shift for that user or dragging an open shift to their user.
- You can schedule a user for multiple shifts in a day.
- Filter to only show shifts for a specific user role (for example servers).
- Modify specific days to require less or more for a specific shift.  For example on a holiday you may want to close or expect 3 instead of 5 servers for the evening shift.

## Data Model <a name = "datamodel"></a>

## üéà What did I learn? <a name="learnings"></a>
This project took a while and I learned loads.
- Data model.  I went through a number of iterations on how to store schedules.  Ultimately I have a much better understanding of when to make certain choices of creating new Schemas/Models/Documents and when to imbed.
- MongoDB.  I hadn't used pipelines before and spend a good deal of time learning how to extract complex data from a database.
- Dates.  Dealing with dates with a server with a different timezone.  I still have more to learn here.
- Authentication.  I understanding authentication a lot more.  Certainly using passport but also middleware in NodeJS.  As part of this project, I did research into sessions & JWT.
- Deploying.  This is deployed in Heroku on the back-end and Netlift for React so learning about how to do that and also dealing with CORS.
- Code organization.  I am reasonably happy with the output but I think there's still opportunity to improve especially with my React components (could be more split up into more appropriate folders).
- React.  I now understanding much better useContext and useReducer.
- MaterialUI.  I wanted to try using something instead of making everything from scratch.  It certainly saved some time and I was able to see many different components.  I liked using the Snackbar - I'd use that more broadly in future projects to help users understand that what they are doing is successful (or unsuccesful)

## üéà Todos <a name="todos"></a>
I have a long list of things I'd work on if I had more time.  Here are some of them:
- Analytics.  I'd love to make a dashboard.  There aren't too many options with the data I currently collect so I'd need to capture some additional information
- Email shifts.  I could integrate with somewhere like Twillio and auto send emails around scheduled shifts or have users request an email of their shifts
- Better error handing
- There's no great handling currently of what happens when shifts are changed from what they were before (for example you were scheduled for a shift type and then the shift type gets changed to a different role.  Very unlikely in the real world but still something I should handle better)
- Responsiveness.  Most of the pages are reasonably responsive but there's certainly more work to be done.
- More validation on forms.  I did this for the registration form to show that I could make it work but could do it on all forms
- Way too much prop drilling on the scheduling page.  I'd move to useContext (if not something like Redux)
- I'd move the API calls outside of components into their own hook
